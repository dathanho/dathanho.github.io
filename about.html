      <p>
        I break things to fix them and I fix things to break them. I learn cause
        it's fun and I'm smart because um... I said so. I live by the second
        because time is the only commodity forever gone. I believe time has
        worth but only valued by what you contribute, and what you experience. I
        try to build anything I dream up and solve the many problems of the
        unknown world. I'm only 14, so my experience will compound, so if you're
        gonna waste my time atleast make it quick. I love technology and cars; I
        love business, finance, and so many other things I can't put in a
        sentence. I built this website because I was bored, and don't even
        question what I put in it because I myself don't know.
